# cState Updates

## v1.0 (November 25, 2017)

**cState is now ready for use in production! With a switch to the Hugo theming system, you can now independently manage incidents, content, settings, while seamlessly keeping cState up to date.**

+ Whole new header design that lets you choose between a logo and just text
+ Updated incident history section and post design
+ Updated config file; added variables for changing the look and feel of your status page
+ Ensured proper legacy browser support by making JavaScript optional
+ Update incident view to include better mini header, clear issue type, and whether it is resolved
+ Updated footer design, added copyright notice
- Removed pinging, which was never properly implemented
- Removed notifications, as they never worked in the first place
- Fixed bug, where the main announcement box would clip, creating a small white 1px border
- Generally removed a lot of leftover cruft and ensured cState is in pristine condition for a stable release
