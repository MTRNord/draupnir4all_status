# Welcome to the cState configuration file!
#
# Hugo is used for building the status page,
# so this file can be used to change how
# your status page should behave or look.
#
# If you want to use special characters,
# such as accented letters, you MUST save
# the file as UTF-8, not ANSI.
#
# If cState does not load, ensure that:
#  - No tabs are present;
#    YAML only allows spaces
#  - Indents are correct
#    YAML hierarchy is based entirely on indentation
#  - You have "escaped" all apostrophes
#    in your text: If you want to write "don't",
#    for example, write "don''t" instead!
#    Note the doubled apostrophe.
#  - Text with symbols is enclosed in single
#    or double quotation marks.
#
# If you have problems, create an issue on GitHub:
# https://github.com/mistermantas/cstate/issues
