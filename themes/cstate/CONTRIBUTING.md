# Contributing Guide

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. Folks like you are more than welcome!

## I want to suggest something, report a bug, etc.

Cool, [just create an issue](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues)!

## I want to write code.

First of all:

**Never merge to master. Merge to dev.**

Some guidelines. You want to make sure that you have:

* Looked, if there was an issue for the thing you are trying to achieve
* If there isn't, create one and discuss your proposal in that issue.

The code you write should be readable to humans. If it is not immediately obvious, add some comments.

## I want to translate

[Read this](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/wiki/Translations#add-your-translations).

## Wait, my question has not been answered.

At the time of writing, cState is such a small project that anyone contributing would be a downright miracle. However, if you are a miracle worker, please do redirect any concerns and they will addressed as soon as humanely possible. [Just create an issue](https://github.com/cstate/cstate/issues)!
